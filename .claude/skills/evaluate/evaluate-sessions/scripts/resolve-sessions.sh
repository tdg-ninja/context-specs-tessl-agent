# resolve-sessions.sh — turn a PR (or feature) into its build-trail session IDs + local trace paths.
#
# The session table is posted on the PR DETERMINISTICALLY BY THE DISPATCHER
# (render_sessions_table -> signal_human_review / signal_stuck / signal_learn_review,
# each ending in `gh pr comment`). That comment is the durable artifact — the local
# .harness/sessions-<f>.tsv is ephemeral and `rm -f`'d on PR cleanup, so we never read it.
#
# Output (one line per session, tab-separated):
#   <session_id>\t<jsonl_path|MISSING>
# Exit 0 if at least one session ID was found; 2 if none (likely no harness comment on the PR).
#
# Usage:
#   resolve-sessions.sh <PR#>
#   resolve-sessions.sh <feature>        # resolves to the PR on feature/<feature> (or learn/<feature>)
#   resolve-sessions.sh <branch>         # any branch name gh recognizes
